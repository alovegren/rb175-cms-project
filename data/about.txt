About

Chichikov, Pavel Ivanovich: echoic of birds chirping and scissors snipping, it is a flighty, frivolous-sounding name, in apparent contrast to the hero's plumpness and practicality.
Manilov (no first name or patronymic): comes from manit, "to lure, to beckon." In sound it is moist-lipped, soft, and gooey.
Korobochka, Nastasya Petrovna: her family name means "little box."
Nozdryov (no first name or patronymic): comes from noz-drya, "nostril," and is suggestive of all sorts of holes and porosities.
Sobakevich, Mikhail Semyonovich: comes from sobaka, "dog."
Mikhail, Mikhailo, and the diminutives Misha and Mishka are common Russian 
names for bears. Plyushkin, Stepan (no patronymic): seems, on the other hand, to have no specific connotations.
